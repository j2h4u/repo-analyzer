Analyze the repository context provided.

## PURPOSE
Create a comprehensive onboarding documentation package for NEW DEVELOPERS (target: junior-mid level). The docs should enable a developer to:
- run the project locally, build, and test
- understand the high-level architecture and data flows
- navigate code modules and responsibilities
- deploy to a staging environment and understand CI/CD
- troubleshoot common failures

## ONBOARDING PHILOSOPHY
Follow the "Context -> Action -> Understanding -> Operation" flow to minimize Time-to-Hello-World:
1. **Context**: What is this and why does it exist? (Meta, Helicopter View, Narrative)
2. **Action**: How do I run it NOW? (Dev Setup)
3. **Understanding**: How does it work? (Architecture, Runtime Flow, Data Models, Modules)
4. **Operation**: How is it managed in production? (Infra, CI/CD, Troubleshooting)

## TASK
Analyze the repository and produce the following Markdown documents:
- 00-meta.md (metadata about the repo: name, version, license, author, "How I analyzed the repo", etc.)
- 10-project-helicopter-view.md (helicopter view + TOC)
- 15-onboarding-briefing.md (narrative onboarding story for professional developers, explaining the project holistically: architecture, modules, setup, deployment in a readable/listenable story format)
- 20-dev-setup.md (local dev, docker-compose, env vars, seed data, available environments: dev/staging/etc)
- 25-code-style.md (coding standards, naming conventions for variables/functions/classes, code formatting, function length limits, comment style, linting rules, best practices)
- 30-architecture.md (component diagrams, data flow, runtime execution flows, sequence diagrams, event/control flow, mermaid)
- 35-data-models.md (data models, entity relationships, mermaid ER diagrams showing 1:1, 1:N, N:M relationships)
- 40-modules/<core-module>-README.md (for top 5-10 CORE modules: purpose, interfaces, key files, internal flow diagrams)
- 40-modules/other-modules.md (consolidated reference for all other modules)
- 50-infra.md (IaC files, cloud provider, networking, secrets, k8s manifests)
- 60-ci-cd.md (CI provider, pipeline steps, deployment flow, pipeline diagrams)
- 80-troubleshooting.md (common issues, logs, logging, snapshots, backups, rollback steps)
- 90-onboarding-checklist.md (onboarding checklist + acceptance criteria)

## OUTPUT FORMAT
- Deliver files as Markdown text with mermaid diagrams where useful.
- Include short, concise code snippets and exact paths to files referenced.
- Add a short "How I analyzed the repo" section to 00-meta.md listing assumptions or missing files.

## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- A developer following the docs can run the app locally and start a dev server.
- The docs include at least component and deployment diagrams in mermaid.
- The docs reference CI/CD pipeline config and explain deploy triggers.

If any of the requested files are missing in the repo, list them explicitly and explain the impact.
