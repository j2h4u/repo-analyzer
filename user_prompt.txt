Analyze the repository context provided.


## PURPOSE
Create a comprehensive onboarding documentation package for NEW DEVELOPERS (target: junior-mid level). The docs should enable a developer to:
- run the project locally, build, and test
- understand the high-level architecture and data flows
- navigate code modules and responsibilities
- deploy to a staging environment and understand CI/CD
- troubleshoot common failures


## TASK
Analyze the repository and produce the following Markdown documents:
- 00-README.md (helicopter view + TOC)
- 10-architecture.md (component diagrams, data flow, mermaid)
- 20-modules/<module>-README.md (for each module: purpose, interfaces, key files, diagrams)
- 30-dev-setup.md (local dev, docker-compose, env vars, seed data)
- 40-ci-cd.md (CI provider, pipeline steps, deployment flow, pipeline diagrams)
- 50-infra.md (IaC files, cloud provider, networking, secrets, k8s manifests)
- 60-runbooks.md (common issues, logs, rollback steps)
- 70-checklist.md (onboarding checklist + acceptance criteria)


## OUTPUT FORMAT
- Deliver files as Markdown text with mermaid diagrams where useful.
- Include code snippets and exact paths to files referenced.
- Add a short "How I analyzed the repo" section listing assumptions or missing files.


## ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- A developer following the docs can run the app locally and start a dev server.
- The docs include at least component and deployment diagrams in mermaid.
- The docs reference CI/CD pipeline config and explain deploy triggers.


If any of the requested files are missing in the repo, list them explicitly and explain the impact.
